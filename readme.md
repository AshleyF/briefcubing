# Trainer

Produce random cases across a set of algs. Solve them with a Giiker cube.

The Giiker may be held in any orientation (I even took the stickers off mine!). The solution may be any alg that works (even mistakes/corrections).

## TODO

* Roofpig-less (optimization)
* Cube status icon (top right) -> battery, disconnect, etc.
* Change feedback link to briefcubing.com
* Desktop support (nice rendering, keyboard support, ...)
* No sleep
* Roux EO/EOLR support
* F2L/SB support

## Backlog

* Localize UI + alg names
